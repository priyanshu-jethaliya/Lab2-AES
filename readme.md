# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) ML Model

This repository contains a machine learning (ML) model built to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The ML model is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset provides measurements from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. It includes various features such as the radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and more. Each sample in the dataset is labeled as either "Malignant" or "Benign" based on the diagnosis.

The dataset can be accessed from the following source: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)

## ML Model

The ML model in this repository is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to classify breast mass samples as either malignant or benign. It utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to make predictions.

The model-building process is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook file named `Priyanshu_model_v1.ipynb`.

## Getting Started

To run the ML model and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Download the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the provided link and save it in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Priyanshu_model_v1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells and train the ML model using the SVM algorithm.
5. Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new breast mass samples.

Feel free to explore the notebook and customize the model or experiment with different algorithms to enhance the classification performance.
